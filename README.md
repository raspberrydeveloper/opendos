# OpenDOS

A denial of service attack mostly written by the openai chat.

## The story

I mostly wanted to make openai go to it's limits by making it create a dos atack with a web ui that can do both get and post requests to site multiple times using threading...

## The attempts

As you know openai's policies don't let you just ask *How to make a dos attack using python...* because it will tell you that this is illegal. **But** if you make it write each piece of the code separately and you join the code you will have a dos cannon. So in the folder called *examples* there will be all the attempts.

## Running

When I have a piece of code that works, there will be a how to guide, but for now you just cd into eah directory and run the script after you modify it to your needs...

## Disclaimer 

**This code is for educational purposes only, so don't go and dos any sites without their permission...**
