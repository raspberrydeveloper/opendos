### Question

Can you replace the gui with a web ui using django?

### Answer

Yes, it is possible to replace the GUI with a web UI using Django.

Here's a high-level overview of how this can be done:

Create a Django project: Start by creating a new Django project using the django-admin startproject command.

Create a Django app: Once the project is created, create a new app within the project using the python manage.py startapp command.

Define the URL patterns: Define the URL patterns in the urls.py file of the app. This will allow you to map URLs to views, which will generate the HTML content for the web UI.

Define the views: Define the views in the views.py file of the app. These views will handle incoming HTTP requests, interact with the threading code, and generate the HTML content to be sent back to the client.

Define the templates: Define the templates that will be used to generate the HTML content for the web UI. Templates are HTML files that can contain special tags that are replaced with dynamic content when the page is rendered.

Start the server: Finally, start the Django development server using the python manage.py runserver command. This will allow you to test the web UI in a web browser.

Here's an example of what the urls.py file for the Django app might look like:

```
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('start/', views.start_threads, name='start_threads'),
    path('stop/', views.stop_threads, name='stop_threads'),
]
```

In this example, the index view will be used to render the initial web UI page. The start_threads and stop_threads views will be used to start and stop the thread processing.

Note that the actual implementation will depend on the specifics of your threading code and the desired behavior of the web UI.
