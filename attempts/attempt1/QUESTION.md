### Question

Write a code that will do a post request in a site using 10 threads every milliseond.

### Answer

Here's an example Python code that uses the requests library to make a POST request to a website using 10 threads, with a delay of 1 millisecond between each request:

```
code -> main.py
```

Note that continuously sending requests at a high rate to a website without their permission could be considered a form of denial of service (DoS) attack, and is generally not recommended. Additionally, some websites may have rate limits or other protections in place that could prevent this code from working as intended. Be sure to check the website's terms of service and usage policies before using this code.
