### Question

Can you add a graphical user interface to it that will let me start, stop the threads and enter the domain?

### Answer

Certainly! Here's an example of how you could modify the code to use a custom tkinter GUI:

```
code -> main.py
```

This code creates a custom tkinter GUI with two buttons: "Start" and "Stop". It also includes an entry box for the user to enter the domain. When the user clicks the "Start" button, the program creates 10 threads and starts sending POST requests to the specified domain every millisecond. When the user clicks the "Stop" button, the program stops all threads.
